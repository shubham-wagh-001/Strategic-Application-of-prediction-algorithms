 Prediction is a widely used machine learning task that can be accomplished with the statistical analysis techniques like Regression. Whereas, A Game, is a situation where
 multiple participants(players) make choices that impact each other’s outcomes. Game theory studies these interactions, analyzing how players with specific goals make strategic decisions. These strategies, which can be pre-determined plans or flexible adaptations, influence the final payoff(gain or loss) each player receives. Since predictions algorithms are heavily used in competition between the companies who offers prediction based products, their strategic use remains unexplored. In this study,We explores the strategic applications of prediction algorithms and thus, our aim is to explore the strategic applications of prediction algorithms i.e. to study how the
 prediction algorithms can be modelled as strategies of the players in the game- theoretic scenario. With the rapid and exponential increase in the amount of data that’s generated, stored, and collected, this growth is happening at a rate that’s challenging our ability to manage it all.
